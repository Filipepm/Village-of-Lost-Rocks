# Village-of-Lost-Rocks

Mystery | History | Preservation

In a broken village, a lone adventurer runs an errand for an old wise man. What this adventurer unlocks is the tale of the village's history and how it came to be in such a sorry state. But not everyone is open to the wise man's tale, nor his explanation on how the village's conflict centers around the lapis lazuli that was once abundant in the area. It's up to the young adventurer to help the old man put together his story and to decide whether or not his story will be remembered.
